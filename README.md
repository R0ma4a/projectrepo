* Task 1: Initialized a Git repository in the projectpro folder/directory, staged the file via git add, and committed it.

* Task 2: also completed within this directory. Added featurex branch, on which added the feature.py file with a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number in it. Verified that the feature.py file is only on featurex branch, not on main. 

* Task 4: completed in addition to tasks 1 and 2, also in this directory.
